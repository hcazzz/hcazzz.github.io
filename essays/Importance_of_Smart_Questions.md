## Introduction
While software engineering is often associated with coding, there are many other crucial aspects that often go unmentioned. One instance of this is asking questions, which plays an essential part of your day to day life as a software engineer and can dramatically impact your experience in the field. By using the principles outlined in "How to Ask Smart Questions" by Eric Raymond, we can learn the ins and outs of asking effective questions. Utilizing this knowledge can allow us to express ourselves clearly, which will help us become a better software engineer.
  
## A Question Lacking Clarity
On platforms like StackOverflow, we can find various examples of both smart and not-so-smart questions. Let's take an example of a not-so-smart question, where the user posed an open-ended question about using Microsoft's Bot Framework. They asked if anyone had experience with this technology because they couldn't find much information about their specific use case. The primary issue here is the open-ended nature of the question, which lacks specific details about their query. When asking questions it's important to provide clear and precise information, especially on platforms like StackOverflow. Additionally, it's clear that the user might not have conducted sufficient research prior to asking this question. Although the user did mention they looked at the documentation. Microsoft's Bot Framework offers extensive documentation, which should have been explored in full before asking the question. You can view the question <a href ="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/77054656/bot-for-microsoft-teams">here</a>.


## Leveraging Resources
Often, when dealing with new technologies, an important skill is the ability to navigate and understand documentation. Documentation not only guides you on how to use a technology but it can also address common issues that may arise while using a technology.  Using documentation can often resolve many questions without the need to post questions on platforms like StackOverflow.

When asking a question, it is good to have a clear understanding of what you are asking. Open-ended or poorly framed questions can be counterproductive, wasting both your time and the time of potential helpers. It’s also important to note that there is no reason you should post a question if a simple google search will yield you the results you need. Anyways, if you find that your question lacks clarity, it may be helpful to take a step back, reassess your requirements, and do further research. Learning to investigate issues independently can be a valuable skill in software engineering and in life in general. With effective researching strategies, you can often find solutions to a wide range of questions related to a specific topic. However, there may be instances where a simple search doesn't yield the answer you’re looking for.

## Effective Inquiry
Distinguishing between smart and less-informed questions can significantly simplify your life as a developer. Consider an example of a smart question on <a href ="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/77057377/linecache-getline-getlines-does-not-actually-work-on-a-txt-file">StackOverflow</a> In this question, the user sought assistance with extracting multiple lines from a .txt file. They provided good information, including their attempted solutions, consulted documentation, and shared their code. On top of this, they gave a hypothesis regarding the issue and asked for input to better understand the problem. This question was also asked in a very polite manner which can also be beneficial when asking questions as this can improve their chances at a useful response. Asking questions using this approach makes it easier for someone experienced in the technology to provide a precise response.

When comparing these two questions, the distinction between a smart and not-so-smart question becomes evident. While browsing StackOverflow, you will encounter many questions that might fall into the latter category. Some users even refer to guides on how to ask smart questions. Many of these not-so-smart questions receive downvotes and may remain unanswered. 

## The Point
For instance, take this question <a href ="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47746807/reversing-diagonal-in-a-matrix-in-java">here</a>. In this case, the user asked a very vague question and provided no information on what they have done or tried. This question received 7 downvotes and the user <a href= "https://stackoverflow.com/users/977855/vins">vinS</a> posted this: “Welcome to stackoverflow. Please read How to ask a good question and How to create a Minimal, Complete, and Verifiable example, before posting a question.”

<a href= "https://stackoverflow.com/users/977855/vins">vinS’s</a> response fits what this essay is about proving why it’s important to learn how to ask smart questions.

As software engineers, developing the skill of effectively posing questions is essential. There may come a day when you face a challenge during a project, and the ability to articulate your question clearly will significantly boost your peers' ability to offer valuable solutions. Clear communication is key in our journey as software developers.
