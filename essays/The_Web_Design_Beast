Do you ever sit there and reminisce about your childhood, waking up early in the morning for Christmas, excited to open Christmas presents? Or maybe you were just excited to get home from school to play video games with your friends. I don’t do this often, but after being slapped in the face with how challenging HTML and CSS can be, I find myself missing those simple times. Learning HTML and CSS was a bit of a nightmare, and the sad part is that I’m not even close to being proficient.

Moving on, there's a whole new beast that appeared - Bootstrap. Now, don’t get me wrong; Bootstrap is not as daunting as the aforementioned technologies, but it still presents its challenges. However, learning new things is always exciting, so that's one thing to be happy about. Besides that, I've found that Bootstrap has proven to be quite beneficial in my short time learning it. Most websites can be easily recreated with Bootstrap, although the same can be said for raw CSS and HTML.

What really sets Bootstrap apart from raw CSS is its quick and easy classes that offer great UI design in less than half the time it would take with CSS. Using Bootstrap, you can easily code up a decent-looking navbar without worrying about different padding and styles, all in just a few minutes. Of course, if one were to be super proficient with CSS, this would be a walk in the park. However, I am not that person, and I think it’s safe to say that I will never be.

If I've learned anything in these past few weeks, it’s that I don’t want to be a UI designer or frontend developer ever. Maybe I’m exaggerating a little, but I find backend work a lot easier than frontend work. But this doesn’t mean I should put off learning HTML, CSS, or Bootstrap. These three technologies are definitely useful to know, and I will definitely keep learning more about them.

So, why Bootstrap? What’s the point of learning it and becoming proficient at it instead of just getting good at CSS? Well, it doesn’t have to be one or the other. Bootstrap offers quick and easy design options with its extensive library of classes that can be applied to do pretty much anything. Some things may take 3-4 lines of CSS, but with Bootstrap, you can apply it all by just giving the element the Bootstrap class name. However, it’s not always black and white; you may find yourself needing to change a specific style, which can be done with a bit of CSS.

So, if you’re planning to learn Bootstrap but not CSS, I’d advise against it. It would be far more beneficial to become more proficient at CSS, especially if you want to be a frontend developer. However, for someone like me, who absolutely hates design, Bootstrap and a little bit of CSS is the way to go. Being forced to remember a bunch of little details like how to center a div or random styling components does not sound like fun to me, and I’d much rather have Bootstrap do the heavy lifting for me.
