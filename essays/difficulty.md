## The Beginning
Like many, my fascination in Software Engineering and programming in general has stemmed from my deep interest with video games. From an early age, video games have been a source of entertainment and I have always wanted to be able to understand how these things work. This has really drove me to pursue Computer Science and Software Engineering. Being able to go through the internet and understand what is happening under the hood when I click a certain button or how certain actions work in a video game is really cool. I hope to be able to gain enough experience in different areas of Software Engineering to where I am able to do this and even create my own version of these things if I wanted.

## My Goals
Software Engineering encompasses many different disciplines, Game Development being one of them. Although I don't necessarily want to study game development as a whole, it is what drove me to what I am doing today. To be able to understand many different topics in Software Engineering is what I hope to gain in the future. I would like to expand my knowledge into various fields such as Cyber Security to Web Development. I know it's impossible to be a master at all of these subfields, so, I would really like to gain a deep knowledge in back-end development working with tools such as C# or JavaScript. Every other topic such as Cyber Security or DevOps would be cool to know and allow me to understand many different applications and how things work.

## The Future
As time passes, I hope to learn a lot from this course (ICS 314) and my Computer Science degree. I believe the knowledge I will gain from this course will benefit me heavily in the future, as it provides me with more experience in things like teamwork and common software engineering practices. In the past courses there wasn't many opportunities  to collaborate in a group to work on a problem. So, I am excited for what this course has to offer.
